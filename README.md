# CGEngine2
> An engine so nice, I had to make it twice!

### Engine Architecture: Data-Oriented Design
CGEngine2 is built on Data-Oriented Design principles, focusing on:

- Optimized memory layouts
- Cache-friendly data structures
- Minimal abstraction overhead
- Performance-driven design

#### Key strategies:
- Contiguous memory allocations
- Direct data manipulation
- Compile-time optimizations

*Performance through intelligent data organization.*

### Requirements:
- **GLFW** - https://github.com/glfw/glfw
- **GLAD** - https://github.com/Dav1dde/glad
